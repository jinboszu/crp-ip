`ILP.py` implements the ILP model for the **restricted CRP with distinct priorities** in Tang et al. (2015). The
following bug in ILP is fixed:

- The index `i` starts with 2 in Constraints (15) in Tang et al. (2015). In such case, `x_{11cp}` are free, which may be
  different from `X_{11cp}` in the solution obtained. In my implementation, Constraints (15) are modified to ensure
  `x_{11cp} = X_{11cp}`.
